README for sedname


OVERVIEW
========

sedname passes filenames through the sed stream editor using a sed script
you specify, and renames the files to the result. If you are familiar with
sed, sedname provides a familiar way to rename batches of files quickly.
sedname can also insert sequential numbers into the filenames to make
them unique, and it includes a simulation mode.
