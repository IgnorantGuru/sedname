Package: sedname
Description: Batch-renames files using a sed script
 sedname passes filenames through the sed stream editor using a sed script
 you specify, and renames the files to the result. If you are familiar with
 sed, sedname provides a familiar way to rename batches of files quickly.
 sedname can also insert sequential numbers into the filenames to make
 them unique, and it includes a simulation mode.
